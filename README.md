# Noiselesshorn
The Noiseless Vehicular Horn system utilizes wireless transmission of modulated signals to produce a low-decibel beep sound near the steering, eliminating irritation to others. An external horn emitting around 63dB is available for urgent situations, ensuring safety without causing discomfort to pedestrians crossing carelessly.
# RF Module Simulation on Proteus

## Overview
This project simulates an RF (Radio Frequency) module using Proteus, a simulation software for electronic circuits. The RF module is designed to transmit and receive data wirelessly.

## Features
- Transmitter and receiver circuit simulation.
- Virtual testing of RF communication in a controlled environment.

## Requirements
1. Proteus: The project was developed and tested on Proteus, so make sure you have the appropriate version installed.
2. Basic knowledge of Proteus and circuit simulation.

## Usage
1. Open Proteus and load the project file:Noiselesshorn.
2. The project includes two sub-circuits: Transmitter and Receiver.
3. Simulate the circuits individually or together to observe wireless communication.
4. Adjust circuit parameters as needed for your specific application.

## Files
- RF transmitter receiver.pdsprj: Proteus project file containing both transmitter and receiver circuits.

## Circuit Details
### Transmitter Circuit
- Includes RF transmitter module, microcontroller, and other components.
- Connects to a virtual signal source to simulate data transmission.

### Receiver Circuit
